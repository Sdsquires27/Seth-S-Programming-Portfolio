# Seth-S-Programming-Portfolio
This is my programming portfolio. This was initially created in my Python class in high school and has many of the projects I have worked on.

Here is a brief overview of each project in this portfolio:

Chucklehead (Python):
I designed this game in python, using pygame, in my programming class. I designed the game by myself, with minimal help or supervision. Chucklehead is a card game that I used to play with my family often, known more commonly as Karma. The rules are included in the title screen of the game. The main challenge I ran into while making this project was the process of selecting multiple cards at once. After trying multiple times to come up with different systems, I essentially had to restart in my process and control the card's selection to be controlled by a seperate entity.

Vessel (Unity, C#):
This game was created for an FBLA statewide competition, which I placed sixth in. The goal was to create a game based on older arcade games. This project took weeks to build, especially because all of it was designed by myself. Everything except for the sound, including the art and programming, was designed by myself. This was the biggest challenge with the project--coming up with concept, documentation, art, and creating the actual project by myself with no supervision whatsover. This was a super fun game to build though, and I was quite pleased with how it turned out.

fight (Unity, C#):
We made this game as a group in my Game Development class. Although some of it, such as the basic features and mechanics of the game, were designed as a whole, I was able to design a lot of my own things as well, like the particle effects and the overall feel of the game.
